## Description 

For this final project I will be combining all the different skills I have learned in my WebDev Journey.  I was very new when I started (had no experience with HTML or CSS) but have learned many new and exciting tools to improve not only my website but myself as a web designer.  Throughout this course I have learned the difference between flex and grid, part of CSS that I still struggle with but am learning as I go.  I have learned how to use hover and dropdowns for menus and navbar purposes, how to import images and proper color schemes.  Before going into this course I had no idea about responsive CSS so that websites could function properly with different viewing screens, but quickly learned through trial and error how necessary it is to have a webpage responsive.
